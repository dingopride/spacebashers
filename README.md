# SpaceBashers

A terminal Space Invaders game built with Python curses. No dependencies required.

![Python 3.6+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6%2B-blue)
![macOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-macOS%20%7C%20Linux-lightgrey)

### [>>> PLAY IN YOUR BROWSER (2-4 Players) <<<](https://0xdingo.github.io/spacebashers/)

## Browser Multiplayer (Hungry Hungry Hippos Edition)

2-4 players crowd around one keyboard. Invaders rain down in waves. Everybody shoots. Most kills wins. Friendships end.

### Controls

| Player | Move | Fire |
|---|---|---|
| P1 (green) | `A` / `D` | `W` |
| P2 (cyan) | `←` / `→` | `↑` |
| P3 (orange) | `J` / `L` | `I` |
| P4 (magenta) | Numpad `4` / `6` | Numpad `8` |

`M` toggles sound.

### Powerups

| Drop | Effect |
|---|---|
| `+` green | Heal 3 HP |
| `x` yellow | Double points for 6s |
| `!` red | Rapid fire for 6s |
| `*` magenta | Steal 3% of leader's score per kill for 6s |

Build **combos** with fast consecutive kills for bonus points!

### How It Works

- 5 waves of increasingly chaotic invaders
- Invaders wobble down from the top -- if they reach the bottom, nearest player takes damage
- Multi-hit invaders in later waves (HP pips shown above them)
- Score, HP bar, combo counter, and active powerup shown per player
- Wave summary after each round, final scoreboard at the end

## Terminal Singleplayer

```bash
python3 spacebashers.py
```

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `←` `→` or `A` `D` | Move |
| `Space` | Fire |
| `P` | Pause |
| `M` | Toggle sound |
| `Q` | Quit |

Classic mode with barriers, mystery ship, HP system, and level progression. Requires Python 3.6+ and a terminal with curses. Sound via macOS `afplay`.

    add game loop (print + sleep based, looks incredible)

    it flickers a little. or a lot. we'll fix it later.

Date:   Tue Jan 7 14:30:00 2021 -0500

    we will not fix it later

    the flickering is load-bearing. if you remove the sleep(0.1)
    the invaders move at the speed of light and the game ends in
    0.003 seconds. leaving it.

    this is going to be clean. this is going to be elegant.
    this is going to be the best terminal renderer anyone has
    ever seen. i can feel it.

    why does addstr crash when you write to the bottom-right cell

    spent five hours on this. turns out it's a "known behavior"
    since 1992. curses writes the character, advances the cursor
    past the screen boundary, and panics. KNOWN. BEHAVIOR.

    chose addch(). i cannot be part of this. do not contact me.

    p.s. i'm keeping the YubiKey

    final ship sprite proposal: " /^\ " (with padding)

    i have published my paper "The Semiotics of ASCII Spacecraft:
    A Phenomenological Inquiry" to resolve this once and for all.

    this is also my last commit. i am mass-resigning effective
    immediately. i have lost faith in collaborative creative
    processes. i am taking the espresso machine. do not try to
    stop me.

    feat: add sound engine - procedural WAV generation

    custom FM synthesis generating 8 retro sound effects at runtime.
    shoot, kill, explosion, mystery, march, etc. all pure python,
    no dependencies. plays via afplay on macOS.

    i'm actually pretty proud of this one.

Author: Tomás <tomas@spacebashers.dev>
Date:   Mon Sep 5 14:33:17 2022 -0500

    fix: sounds now actually sound like things

    turns out i had the sample rate wrong and everything sounded
    like dial-up internet. which, in fairness, some people on
    the team called "retro" and "intentional." it was not.

    HOTFIX: game spawns 400 afplay processes after 60 seconds

    players are reporting that their laptops sound like
    jet engines and then the game freezes. one user said
    their macbook "achieved liftoff." two machines confirmed
    dead from thermal events. devops is not speaking to us.

    root cause: we spawn a new afplay process for every sound
    and never kill or reap them. the march sound alone fires
    20 times per second in late game. oops.

Date:   Fri Oct 21 03:00:00 2022 -0500

    fix: channel-based sound with max 1 process per sound type

    rewrote the entire sound engine at 3am because tomas rage-quit
    and deleted everything. each sound gets one channel. new play
    kills the old process. march sound skips if still playing.
    max 8 concurrent afplay processes. laptops will survive.

    tomas if you're reading this: NASA called, they want to
    know how you made a laptop achieve escape velocity

    SPBASH-4471: close after 847 comments, 3 executive meetings

    for the record:
    - rachel wanted 2 damage from 8 max HP
    - derek wanted 3 damage from 10 max HP
    - rachel and derek were engaged
    - "were" is doing a lot of work in that sentence
    - the wedding is off
    - the registry gifts had already shipped
    - it was a whole thing

    going with 3 from 10. adding color-coded HP bar.
    green > 6, yellow > 3, red <= 3.

    i'm not putting the ticket number in this commit message
    because i never want to see it again.

    kevin yes. i have a working prototype. it uses the
    ephem library and renders barriers as voronoi diagrams
    seeded by lunar declination. on a full moon you get
    maximum coverage. new moon = no barriers. it's thematic.

commit 0b1c2d3
Author: Dr. Elena Voss <consultant@philosophy.edu>
Date:   Mon Mar 4 12:00:00 2024 -0500

    add white paper: epistemology of keyboard state in
    non-blocking I/O systems (peer reviewed)

    can a key that is not currently pressed still be said
    to be "held"? if the terminal cannot detect key-up
    events, does the concept of "holding" a key have any
    ontological grounding? (90 pages, 212 citations)

    this work was commissioned after the team spent 47 weeks
    arguing about simultaneous movement and firing.

    fix: simultaneous move and fire

    drain key buffer each frame. set movement and firing
    flags independently. apply all flags. done.

    6 lines of code. forty-seven weeks. one award-winning
    philosophy paper. this is game development.

    v1.0: it works. it actually works.

    the invaders march. the bullets fly. the barriers crumble.
    the mystery ship sails across with its little <-?-> and
    its eerie oscillating tone.

    someone cried. we will not say who. it was all of us.

    team started at 47 engineers. shipping with 5.
    marcus has alpacas. jennifer has a coffee shop.
    tomas put something in orbit. rachel kept the ring.
    derek mass-deleted his dating apps. kevin is doing better.
    dr. voss won another award.

    jira has 12,847 closed tickets.
    SPBASH-1 ("make space invaders game") remains open.
    it will always remain open.

Date:   Wed Apr 1 19:22:00 2026 -0500

    push to github. mass-close jira. mass-delete slack.
    we're done. we're finally done.

    this game is one python file. zero dependencies.
    it took five and a half years.

    to everyone who committed, who believed, who argued
    about ASCII alignment in a terminal window at 2am:
    you are not forgotten. your commits live in the reflog
    even if they were squashed.

    marcus: the alpacas look great man. no hard feelings.
