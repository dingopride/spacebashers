# SpaceBashers

Space Invaders, reimagined for the terminal by someone who probably should have stopped three features ago but didn't. No dependencies. No frameworks. No excuses.

---

## Browser Edition

Open `index.html` or visit [0xdingo.github.io/spacebashers](https://0xdingo.github.io/spacebashers/).

1-4 players crowd around one keyboard. Invaders rain down in waves. Everybody shoots. Most kills wins.

### Controls

| Player | Move | Fire |
|---|---|---|
| P1 (green) | `A` / `D` | `W` |
| P2 (cyan) | `←` / `→` | `↑` |
| P3 (orange) | `J` / `L` | `I` |
| P4 (magenta) | Numpad `4` / `6` | Numpad `8` |

`M` toggles sound. Select 1-4 players on the setup screen.

### Game Flow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Title
    Title --> Setup: SPACE
    Setup --> Countdown: SPACE
    Countdown --> Playing: 3..2..1..GO
    Playing --> WaveEnd: All invaders cleared / all players dead
    WaveEnd --> Playing: Next wave (if waves remain)
    WaveEnd --> Results: Wave 5 complete or all dead
    Results --> Title: Q
    Results --> Setup: SPACE
```

### Powerups

Killed invaders have a 12% chance to drop a powerup. Powerups fall toward the bottom and are collected on contact.

| Drop | Char | Color | Effect | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Heal | `+` | green | Restore 3 HP | Instant |
| Double | `x` | yellow | 2x points per kill | 6 seconds |
| Rapid | `!` | red | Fire cooldown drops from 150ms to 60ms | 6 seconds |
| Steal | `*` | magenta | Each kill steals 3% of the richest opponent's score | 6 seconds |

```mermaid

## Terminal Classic

```bash
python3 spacebashers.py
```

The original. Where it all began. A love letter to 1978 rendered in Unicode box-drawing characters and hubris.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `←` `→` or `A` `D` | Move ship |
| `Space` | Fire (hold to rapid-fire) |
| `P` | Pause |
| `M` | Toggle sound |
| `Q` | Quit |

### How Classic Mode Works

```mermaid
flowchart TD

    B --> C[Set move/fire flags]
    C --> D[Apply Movement]
    D --> E[Apply Firing with cooldown]
    E --> F[Move Bullets]
    F --> G[Move Invader Grid]
    G --> H{Hit boundary?}

    H -->|No| J[Continue lateral]
    I --> K[Speed up based on alive count]
    J --> K
    K --> L[Enemy Fires from bottom row]
    L --> M[Collision Detection]
    M --> N[Draw Frame]
    N --> A
```

**Features:**
- 5 rows of invaders with different sprites and point values (10/20/30 pts)
- Mystery ship flyovers for bonus points (50-300 pts)
- 4 destructible barriers with arch cutouts
- HP system with color-coded health bar (10 HP, 3 damage per hit, survives 3 hits)
- Invaders accelerate as their numbers thin: `speed = max(0.05, 0.5 * alive/total)`
- Procedurally generated retro sound effects via macOS `afplay`
- Level progression: each cleared wave increases invader speed and enemy fire rate

### Invader Grid Layout

```
Row 0:  (@@) (@@) (@@) (@@) (@@) (@@) (@@) (@@)   30 pts  white
Row 1:  <**> <**> <**> <**> <**> <**> <**> <**>   20 pts  cyan

## Network Multiplayer

Same hungry hungry hippos gameplay as the browser edition, but over the network via TCP. Pure Python stdlib. Zero dependencies. We implemented a custom client-server architecture with authoritative host simulation, state snapshot broadcasting, and buffered stream parsing for a game about shooting ASCII aliens in a terminal. We regret nothing.

### Quick Start

**Host a game (also plays as P1):**
```bash
python3 netplay.py host [--port 7777]
```
Displays your LAN IP on startup. Press SPACE to start -- works solo or with up to 3 others.

**Join a game:**
```bash
python3 netplay.py join 192.168.1.X [--port 7777] [--name YourName]
```

### Controls

All players use the same keys: `A`/`D` to move, `W` or `↑` to fire. `M` toggles sound. `Q` quits.

Host presses `SPACE` to start rounds and can start solo or wait for players to join.

### Network Game Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant H as Host
    participant C1 as Client 1
    participant C2 as Client 2

    Note over H: Starts server on port 7777
    Note over H: Displays LAN IP

    C1->>H: {"t":"join","name":"Alice"}
    H->>C1: {"t":"assign","id":1,"name":"Alice"}

    C2->>H: {"t":"join","name":"Bob"}
    H->>C2: {"t":"assign","id":2,"name":"Bob"}

    Note over H: Host presses SPACE

    loop Every 50ms (20Hz)
        C1->>H: {"t":"input","l":true,"r":false,"f":true}
        C2->>H: {"t":"input","l":false,"r":true,"f":false}
        Note over H: Tick simulation (60Hz internally)
        H->>C1: {"t":"state", ...full game state...}
        H->>C2: {"t":"state", ...full game state...}
    end

    Note over C1,C2: Clients render locally + play sounds
```

## System Architecture

Three files. Three runtimes. One shared vision of what a terminal game can be if you refuse to acknowledge scope creep as a concept.

## The Sound Engine

Both `spacebashers.py` and `netplay.py` include an identical `SoundEngine` class that generates every sound effect from pure math at startup. No audio files. No WAV assets. No CDN. Just sine waves, noise, and an unreasonable amount of confidence that this would work. It did.

The browser version achieves the same thing with Web Audio API oscillators, because we don't half-commit to anything around here.

### How Terminal Sounds Work

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Game Event (shoot, kill, etc.)"] --> B[SoundEngine.play name]
    B --> C{Sound enabled?}
    C -->|No| D[Return]
    C -->|Yes| E{Channel busy?}
    E -->|Yes, short sfx| F["Skip (don't pile up)"]
    E -->|Yes, long sfx| G[Kill previous process]
    E -->|No| H["Spawn: afplay /tmp/.../name.wav"]
    G --> H
    H --> I[Store process in channels dict]
```

### WAV Generation Pipeline

All sounds are generated at startup from math -- no audio files ship with the game.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Sine wave generator] --> D[Concat samples]
    B[Frequency sweep] --> D
    C[White noise generator] --> D
    D --> E["Pack as 16-bit PCM"]
    E --> F["Write .wav to /tmp"]
    F --> G["Play via afplay (async subprocess)"]
```

### Sound Catalog

| Sound | Waveform | Frequency | Duration | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `shoot` | Sine decay | 880Hz → 440Hz | 120ms | Player fires |
| `kill` / `invader_kill` | Square + noise | 600Hz → 300Hz + burst | 160ms | Invader destroyed |
| `player_hit` | Noise + sine | White + 100Hz | 300ms | Player takes damage |
| `mystery` | FM sine | 200Hz wobble ±100Hz | 400ms | Mystery ship appears |
| `mystery_hit` | Square arpeggio | C5→E5→G5→C6 | 390ms | Mystery ship destroyed |
| `march` | Square | 80Hz → 60Hz | 100ms | Invader grid steps |
| `game_over` | Square descend | A4→F#4→E4→C4 | 1000ms | All HP gone |
| `level_up` / `round_end` | Square ascend | C5→E5→G5→C6 | 600ms | Wave cleared |
| `bonus_drop` | Sine | 1200Hz | 80ms | Powerup spawns |
| `bonus_grab` | Square arpeggio | C5→G5→C6 | 180ms | Powerup collected |
| `steal` | Sawtooth | 200Hz → 150Hz | 200ms | Score stolen |
| `countdown` | Square | 440Hz | 150ms | 3.. 2.. 1.. |
| `countdown_go` | Square | 880Hz | 300ms | GO! |

### Channel System (Process Management)

The naive approach spawned an `afplay` process per sound and the laptop achieved escape velocity after 60 seconds. The channel system -- born at 3 AM from the ashes of Tomas's rage-quit -- is arguably the most elegant process pool ever designed for a game that runs in a terminal. We're not saying it's production-grade. We're saying production should aspire to this.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["play('shoot')"] --> B{"channels['shoot'] alive?"}
    B -->|Yes, short sfx| C["SKIP - don't accumulate"]
    B -->|Yes, long sfx| D["KILL previous process"]
    B -->|No| E["Spawn afplay"]
    D --> E
    E --> F["channels['shoot'] = new process"]

    style C fill:#332200,stroke:#cccc00,color:#cccc00
    style D fill:#330000,stroke:#ff3333,color:#ff3333
    style E fill:#003300,stroke:#00ff00,color:#00ff00
```

**Max concurrent processes: 8** (one per sound name). Short sounds like `shoot` and `kill` simply skip if their channel is busy, which naturally rate-limits them. Longer sounds kill the previous instance.

---

## Network Protocol

Yes, we wrote a custom network protocol for a terminal game. Yes, it was necessary. No, we will not be using WebSockets like normal people.

### Wire Format

Newline-delimited JSON over TCP. Every message is a single JSON object followed by `\n`. Simple, debuggable, and you can literally `nc` into a game server and watch the state fly by in your terminal. Not that we've done that. Okay, we've done that.

```
{"t":"input","l":true,"r":false,"f":true}\n
{"t":"state","st":"playing","wave":2,...}\n
```

Nagle's algorithm is disabled (`TCP_NODELAY`) for low latency.

### Message Types

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Client → Host"
        A["join<br/>{t:join, name:str}"]
        B["input<br/>{t:input, l:bool, r:bool, f:bool}"]
        C["quit<br/>{t:quit}"]
    end

    subgraph "Host → Client"
        D["assign<br/>{t:assign, id:int, name:str}"]
        E["state<br/>{t:state, st:str, players:[], invaders:[], bullets:[], bonuses:[], explosions:[], snd:[]}"]
        F["kicked<br/>{t:kicked, reason:str}"]
    end
```

### State Snapshot Structure

The `state` message is the heart of the protocol. Broadcast at 20Hz, it contains the entire renderable game state:

```json
{
  "t": "state",
  "st": "playing",
  "wave": 3,
  "tw": 5,
  "players": [
    {
      "id": 0, "name": "Host", "color": "green",
      "ship": " /^\\ ",
      "x": 40.0, "y": 37,
      "hp": 7, "mhp": 10,
      "score": 1250, "kills": 23,
      "alive": true,
      "pw": "rapid", "combo": 4,
      "last_kill": 1234.5
    }
  ],
  "invaders": [
    {"x": 30.5, "y": 12.3, "sp": "(@@)", "hp": 1, "mhp": 2, "color": "cyan"}
  ],
  "bullets": [
    {"x": 42, "y": 20.5, "owner": 0, "color": "green"}
  ],
  "bonuses": [
    {"x": 25, "y": 18.2, "char": "+", "color": "green"}
  ],
  "explosions": [
    {"x": 30, "y": 12, "f": 2, "color": "green"}
  ],
  "snd": ["kill", "shoot"],
  "cn": 0
}
```

The `snd` array contains sound effect names that fired since the last snapshot. Clients play these locally so audio stays in sync without separate sound messages.

### Connection Lifecycle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant H as Host

    C->>H: TCP connect
    C->>H: {"t":"join","name":"Alice"}

    alt Game full or in progress
        H->>C: {"t":"kicked","reason":"Game full"}
        H--xC: Close connection
    else Accepted
        H->>C: {"t":"assign","id":1,"name":"Alice"}
        Note over H: Spawns receiver thread for client

        loop Game in progress
            C->>H: {"t":"input",...} (20Hz)
            H->>C: {"t":"state",...} (20Hz)
        end

        alt Client quits
            C->>H: {"t":"quit"}
            Note over H: Mark player dead, close socket
        else Client disconnects
            Note over H: recv returns empty, mark player dead
        else Host quits
            Note over C: recv returns None, show error
        end
    end
```

### Buffered Receive Protocol

TCP is a stream protocol. Messages may arrive fragmented or concatenated. Most people learn this the hard way in production at 2 AM. We learned it the hard way in a terminal game at 2 AM, which is arguably worse. The `recv_msgs` function handles this correctly on the first try (it was not the first try):

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["recv(65536) into buffer"] --> B{"Buffer contains \\n?"}
    B -->|No| C[Return empty list<br/>partial data stays in buffer]
    B -->|Yes| D[Split on first \\n]
    D --> E[Parse left side as JSON]
    E --> F[Remainder stays in buffer]
    F --> B
    C --> G[Next call continues from buffer]
```

This ensures no data loss even when TCP delivers partial messages or multiple messages in a single `recv`.

## Game Mechanics Deep Dive

Every number in this section was the result of extensive playtesting, heated debate, and at least one broken engagement. The tuning is tight. Trust the tuning.

### Scoring System

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Kill Invader] --> B[Base Points]
    B --> C{"Powerup active?"}
    C -->|Double| D["pts × 2"]
    C -->|None| E["pts × 1"]
    D --> F[Combo Bonus]
    E --> F
    F --> G["+ (combo - 1) × 5"]
    G --> H{"Steal active?"}
    H -->|Yes| I["+ 3% of richest opponent's score"]
    H -->|No| J[Final Score Added]
    I --> J
```

### Combo System

Kills within 1.5 seconds of each other build a combo chain.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Kill at t=0"] -->|"< 1.5s"| B["Kill at t=0.8<br/>combo=2<br/>+5 bonus"]
    B -->|"< 1.5s"| C["Kill at t=1.5<br/>combo=3<br/>+10 bonus"]
    C -->|"> 1.5s"| D["Kill at t=4.0<br/>combo resets to 1"]
```

Max combo: 10x (+45 bonus per kill).

### Wave Scaling

Each wave spawns more invaders that are harder to kill.

| Wave | Invaders | Spawn Interval | Invader HP | Base Speed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 23 | 0.54s | 1 | 0.025 |
| 2 | 31 | 0.48s | 1 | 0.030 |
| 3 | 39 | 0.42s | 2 | 0.035 |
| 4 | 47 | 0.36s | 2 | 0.040 |
| 5 | 55 | 0.30s | 2 | 0.045 |

Formula:
- Invaders per wave: `15 + wave × 8`
- Spawn interval: `max(0.15, 0.6 - wave × 0.06)` seconds
- Invader HP: `1 + floor(wave / 3)`
- Base fall speed: `0.02 + wave × 0.005` units/tick

### Invader Movement

Unlike classic mode's rigid grid, multiplayer invaders fall independently with sinusoidal wobble:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Spawn at random x, y=-1"] --> B["Each tick:"]
    B --> C["y += speed × dt × 60"]
    B --> D["wobblePhase += 0.1 × dt × 60"]
    B --> E["x += sin(wobblePhase) × wobble × dt × 60"]
    C --> F{"y >= ROWS - 2?"}
    F -->|Yes| G["Damage nearest player (-2 HP)<br/>Despawn"]
    F -->|No| B
```

### HP and Damage

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Player Starts] --> B["HP: 10 / 10"]
    B --> C{"Damage Source"}
    C -->|"Enemy bullet (classic)"| D["-3 HP"]
    C -->|"Invader reaches bottom (multi)"| E["-2 HP"]
    D --> F{"HP <= 0?"}
    E --> F
    F -->|Yes| G[Player Dies]
    F -->|No| H[Continue Playing]

    style B fill:#003300,stroke:#00ff00,color:#00ff00
    style G fill:#330000,stroke:#ff3333,color:#ff3333
```

HP bar color thresholds: green (>6), yellow (>3), red (<=3).

### Classic Mode Invader Speed

The invader grid accelerates as aliens are destroyed:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["40/40 alive<br/>speed = 0.50s"] --> B["30/40 alive<br/>speed = 0.375s"]
    B --> C["20/40 alive<br/>speed = 0.25s"]
    C --> D["10/40 alive<br/>speed = 0.125s"]
    D --> E["1/40 alive<br/>speed = 0.05s<br/>(PANIC MODE)"]
```

Formula: `speed = max(0.05, 0.5 × alive/total)` seconds between grid steps.

    the flickering is load-bearing. if you remove the sleep(0.1)
    the invaders move at the speed of light and the game ends in
    0.003 seconds. leaving it.

    why does addstr crash when you write to the bottom-right cell

    spent five hours on this. turns out it's a "known behavior"
    since 1992. curses writes the character, advances the cursor
    past the screen boundary, and panics. KNOWN. BEHAVIOR.

    custom FM synthesis generating 8 retro sound effects at runtime.

    HOTFIX: game spawns 400 afplay processes after 60 seconds

    players are reporting that their laptops sound like
    jet engines and then the game freezes. one user said
    their macbook "achieved liftoff." two machines confirmed
    dead from thermal events. devops is not speaking to us.

    root cause: we spawn a new afplay process for every sound
    and never kill or reap them. the march sound alone fires
    20 times per second in late game. oops.

    fix: channel-based sound with max 1 process per sound type

    rewrote the entire sound engine at 3am because tomas rage-quit
    and deleted everything. each sound gets one channel. new play
    kills the old process. march sound skips if still playing.
    max 8 concurrent afplay processes. laptops will survive.

    tomas if you're reading this: NASA called, they want to
    know how you made a laptop achieve escape velocity

    for the record:
    - rachel wanted 2 damage from 8 max HP
    - derek wanted 3 damage from 10 max HP
    - rachel and derek were engaged
    - "were" is doing a lot of work in that sentence
    - the wedding is off
    - the registry gifts had already shipped
    - it was a whole thing

    going with 3 from 10. adding color-coded HP bar.
    green > 6, yellow > 3, red <= 3.

    add white paper: epistemology of keyboard state in
    non-blocking I/O systems (peer reviewed)

    can a key that is not currently pressed still be said
    to be "held"? if the terminal cannot detect key-up
    events, does the concept of "holding" a key have any
    ontological grounding? (90 pages, 212 citations)

    this work was commissioned after the team spent 47 weeks
    arguing about simultaneous movement and firing.

    v1.0: it works. it actually works.

    the invaders march. the bullets fly. the barriers crumble.
    the mystery ship sails across with its little <-?-> and
    its eerie oscillating tone.

    someone cried. we will not say who. it was all of us.

    team started at 47 engineers. shipping with 5.
    marcus has alpacas. jennifer has a coffee shop.
    tomas put something in orbit. rachel kept the ring.
    derek mass-deleted his dating apps. kevin is doing better.
    dr. voss won another award.

    jira has 12,847 closed tickets.
    SPBASH-1 ("make space invaders game") remains open.
    it will always remain open.

    v2.0: multiplayer. because the single-player mode wasn't
    destroying enough friendships.

    added hungry hungry hippos mode: 1-4 players, invaders
    rain from the sky, everyone fights for kills. powerups,
    combos, score stealing. browser version AND network play.

    derek called. he wants to know if rachel is playing.
    we told him to touch grass. he said the grass reminds
    him of the green HP bar. we hung up.

    SPBASH-1 remains open.
